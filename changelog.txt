Updates:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.00.00a-rrd     03-April-2013
   Limitations
   - Limited restrain capabilities (only clamped nodes allowed).
   - Only Euler-Bernoulli(E-B) or 2-node Timoshenko element formulation (in the future tapered E-B and tapered T will be implemented).
   - Only circular members allowed (in the future a generic cross-section will be allowed).
   - Reaction force calculated at (0,0,0) SS-reference frame (e.g., sea-bed level); in the future a reference location will be user input.
   - Meshing capabilities within the modularization framework not yet implemented.
   - The code has not yet been fully integrated with FAST.
   - Reaction forces are not output yet. To be implemented shortly.
   - Due to licensing restrictions with the solver used during development, we cannot distribute the solver at this time. Later versions will contain a distributable solver.

v0.04.00a-rrd     03-October-2013
    Official FAST 8.x public release
      Limitations
      1.	Tight coupling is not yet supported.
      2.	Only limited error checking of user’s input is implemented.  Carefully examine the input file if unexpected errors are found.
      3.	Limited restraint capabilities are available (only clamped nodes allowed).
      4.	Only nontapered Euler-Bernoulli (E-B) or a 2-node Timoshenko (T) element formulations are available (in the future, tapered E-B and tapered T will be implemented).
      5.	Only circular members are permitted (in the future, a generic cross-section will be allowed).
      6.	Reaction loads are calculated at (0,0,-Wdepth) substructure (SS) reference frame (e.g., sea-bed level); in the future, a reference location will be user input.
      7.	The number of elements per member (NDiv) is constant throughout the structure.
      8.	The code has not yet been coupled with HydroDyn.
      9.	Limited testing has been conducted; use caution in interpreting the results and try different numbers of retained modes to ensure convergence of the results if using CBMod.
      10.	Internal matrices are not stored in sparse form, limiting the total number of possible nodes/degrees of freedom (DOF)/finite elements to about 300/1800.
      11.	Foundation (soil-structure interaction) modeling is not yet available.
      12.	The dynamics system reduction is performed in the absence of external loading.
      13.	Gravitational loading does not impact the global substructure stiffness.
      14.	Loads (gravitational, inertial, hydrodynamic) can only be applied as concentrated loads at element nodes; distributed loads (per unit length) are not yet supported.
      15.	Compiling requires the Intel Math Kernel Library (gfortran is not yet supported). Note that IMKL routines used in this release are publicly available LAPACK routines at http://www.netlib.org/lapack .
